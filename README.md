This repository demonstrates a common error in Dockerfiles and its solution. The initial Dockerfile fails to build because of missing `apt-get clean`. The solution includes adding this instruction to clean up downloaded packages, ensuring a smaller and faster image.  The `apt-get clean` command removes downloaded package files, freeing up disk space. This is crucial when building Docker images to keep the image size small and prevent potential issues from conflicting package files.
